penduinART
==========

HTML5 Game engine.  Piece together multiple images into armatures and settings
which are easy to adjust and animate.  Assets are plain images, structural
data is plain JSON, and code is plain JavaScript.


Where to start
--------------

The files "thingmaker.html" and "test.html" are the most interesting at the
moment.  They're not pretty, but using and editing them will show you around
the current state of penduinART.

Eventually, "src/penduinart.js" will be the main engine.

Probably, "src/smogheapinput.js" will be revamped and become its own thing.


Philosophy
----------

penduinART aims to be:
- Useful for quickly turning scribbles (or even good artwork ;^) into games.
- Dependency-free.  If someone wants JQuery or whatever, that's their problem.
- Fun and easy for 2D web games.  Not one engine to rule them all.
- Efficient and fast, though not at the expense of clarity or ease of use.
- FirefoxOS phone ready.  (And any low-end but highly-interesting web device.)
- Free as in speech, free as in beer, free to learn from and build upon.


State of penduinART
-------------------

Working right now:
- base engine supports loading image resources and rendering
- "thingmaker" tool helps easily arrange images into armatures
- simple examples showing penduinART usage

Planned features:
- poses and animations supported in engine and "thingmaker"
- generic input mapper with keyboard, mouse, gamepad, touch support
- "placemaker" tool for easily creating multi-layered scrollable settings
- full scene support in engine
- game templates for easily starting new projects
- music assets: loading and customizable looping
